##### Solving coding problems in interviews
Recruiters look out for four major attributes:
- Analytic skills: ability to think through a problem and break it down
- Coding skills: adequate knowledge of the programming language
- Technical skills: understanding the pros and cons of different solutions
- Communication skills: working well within the company

Step by step guide:
- Write down the crux of the problem in clesr terms
- Confirm the inputs and outputs (data types)
- Note the most important value of the problem: time, space and memory consideration.
- Start with the naive, easiest brute-force approach
- Tell the interviewer why the approach above is not the best (avoid nested loops where possible).
- Walk through your approach, make comments on important steps, take note of edge scenarios
- Before you begin coding, walk through your code and write down the steps you want to carry out
- Modularize your code from the very beginning
- Start coding
- Think about error checks and how you can break the code
- Test your code: check for null, massive sizes,, emptu arrays/objects
- Talk to the interviewer where you would improve the code
